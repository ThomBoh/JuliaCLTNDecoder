The SVD algorithm `"divide_and_conquer"` has thrown an error,
likely because of a convergance failure. You can try
other SVD algorithms that may converge better using the
`alg` (or `svd_alg` if called through `factorize` or MPS/MPO functionality) keyword argument:

 - "divide_and_conquer" is a divide-and-conquer algorithm
   (LAPACK's `gesdd`). It is fast, but may lead to some innacurate
   singular values for very ill-conditioned matrices.
   It also may sometimes fail to converge, leading to errors
   (in which case `"qr_iteration"` or `"recursive"` can be tried).

 - `"qr_iteration"` (LAPACK's `gesvd`) is typically slower 
   than "divide_and_conquer", especially for large matrices,
   but is more accurate for very ill-conditioned matrices 
   compared to `"divide_and_conquer"`.

 - `"recursive"` is ITensor's custom SVD algorithm. It is very
   reliable, but may be slow if high precision is needed.
   To get an `svd` of a matrix `A`, an eigendecomposition of
   ``A^{\dagger} A`` is used to compute `U` and then a `qr` of
   ``A^{\dagger} U`` is used to compute `V`. This is performed
   recursively to compute small singular values.

Returning `nothing`. For an output `F = svd(A, ...)` you can check if
`isnothing(F)` in your code and try a different algorithm.

To suppress this message in the future, you can wrap the `svd` call in the
`@suppress` macro from the `Suppressor` package.
